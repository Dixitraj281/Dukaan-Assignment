# project_overview
This React web application implements a dashboard-style interface with several components for navigation, overview, and transaction details.

## Components Overview
### Sidebar
The Sidebar component creates a fixed sidebar with a collapsible menu. It includes a logo, the application name ("Dukaan"), a link to visit the store, and information about available credits. The sidebar can be expanded or collapsed using ChevronUp and ChevronDown icons.

### Navbar
The Navbar component represents the top navigation bar with links for "Payout," a help icon with the text "How it works," and a search input field. Icons for a user group and a menu are also included.

### Home Page
The Table component displays an overview section with information about next payouts, amounts pending, and amounts processed. It also includes a table with transaction details for the current month.

## Dependencies
1. React.js
2. Lucide Icons Library

## Styling
Styling is achieved using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework and external css files.
